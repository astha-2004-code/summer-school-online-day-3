## üñº Final Layout (Using Grid)

The blog layout is created using CSS Grid to arrange the header, sidebar, main content, and footer in a clean structure.

üß© Grid Structure

|  Header            |
|  Sidebar |  Main   |
|  Footer            |

This structure was built using the following grid properties:


üîπ display: grid

Defines the layout container as a grid.

.container {
  display: grid;
}


üîπ grid-template-areas

Defines named grid areas so elements can be placed easily.

.container {
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
}

Here:

"header header" makes the header span both columns.

"sidebar main" places sidebar and main content side by side.

"footer footer" makes the footer full width again.


üîπ grid-template-columns & grid-template-rows

Specifies the size of columns and rows.

.container {
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

First column (sidebar) is fixed at 250px

Second column (main) takes remaining space

Rows are: header, main area, and footer


üîπ grid-area

This assigns HTML elements to named areas defined above.

header   { grid-area: header; }
aside    { grid-area: sidebar; }
main     { grid-area: main; }
footer   { grid-area: footer; }


üì± Responsive Layout with Media Queries

The layout is fully responsive, and for screen widths below 768px, the grid layout becomes vertical using a media query.

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    grid-template-areas:
      "header"
      "sidebar"
      "main"
      "footer";
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}

All elements stack vertically on mobile

No horizontal scroll

Sidebar and content are easier to read


üìå Sticky Sidebar (Using position: sticky)

The navigation sidebar uses the position: sticky property so it stays fixed in place while scrolling the main content.

.sticky-sidebar {
  position: sticky;
  top: 1rem;
}

position: sticky makes the sidebar "stick" when it reaches top: 1rem from the top of the viewport.

It's better than fixed because it scrolls within its container.

This keeps navigation visible and user-friendly.
